# case_study:
# - question: The Challenge
#   answer: "Before the organisation started hiring junior talent through Makers Academy, Compare The Market was finding it challenging to recruit quality junior software engineers.
#   The team had tried a few different sources, including universities and job boards, but ultimately had trouble attracting a high enough calibre of people. The volume of applicants was high, but they were finding it hard to spot talent through the noise."
#
# - question: The Solution
#   answer: "Dan Bass started working with Makers Academy to try and locate engineers with the right behaviours that would grow with the business. For a while, his ambition had been to bring in correct behaviours rather than skills, because he knew his organisation could teach skills more easily than teaching attitude.
#   In 2011, Compare the Market launched its own academy to try and deal with the talent shortage, but found it was ultimately too expensive and complicated to maintain. The leadership team knew what kinds of people they wanted to work with, but couldn’t produce a reasonable funnel of talent by themselves.
#   When Dan met Ruben, (COO of Makers) he discovered an immediate synergy between the two businesses.
#   “We had so much in common around the values of developing, it really worked.” The emphasis placed on constant improvement of the curriculum was also a huge factor for Dan in deciding to work together.
#   “The only risk we were taking was the slight difference in tech stack,” said Dan. “Your developers don’t learn C# as part of the course so there was a risk that they might have been too inexperienced. However, all xxNUMBER of developers we’ve hired have hit the ground running because they have the right problem-solving approach and picked up the skills very quickly.”"
# - question: The Result: How would you describe the effect we’ve had on your business?
#   answer: "“The people that we’ve hired have all made a positive impact. Everyone really respects them, they have the right attitude. Without Makers Academy I’d have to go back to the drawing board for junior tech recruitment!”
#   The consistent pipeline of software engineers from Makers Academy has also resulted in a growing community of Makers within Compare the Market - an unexpected benefit Dan wants to build upon and take advantage of."
